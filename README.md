# Clojure-Is-Prime
This program does three things - 1st Checks if a number "is-prime?" T
Then 2nd has a function called “prime-seq” which receives two integer arguments, “from” and “to”, and returns a sequence containing only the prime numbers between “from” and “to" 
finally a function called “doprimes”, which prints the 10 largest prime numbers between two given integers, “from” and “to”, and the sum of them



How to use. 

To check if a number is prime, you type (is-prime? 100) then for this example is will return false.

To check prime numbers within a sequence (prime-seq 100 200) then this will return a string with prime numbers between 100-200.

To check the 10 largest prime numbers between two given integers you use (doprimes 1 10) this will return a string of the biggest
integers between them.
