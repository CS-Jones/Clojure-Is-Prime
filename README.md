# Clojure-Is-Prime
This program does three things - 1st Checks if a number "is-prime?" T
Then 2nd has a function called “prime-seq” which receives two integer arguments, “from” and “to”, and returns a sequence containing only the prime numbers between “from” and “to" 
finally a function called “doprimes”, which prints the 10 largest prime numbers between two given integers, “from” and “to”, and the sum of them
